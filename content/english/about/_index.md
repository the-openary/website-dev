The Openary is a project started by Alex in 2023 as an extension to Neutrino during its development. We're here to make awesome, accessible projects that help others. More importantly though, we will be fully transparent on every step along the way. We believe that by showing and explaining the development process in depth, we can enable others not just to copy schematics, but to design for themselves.
