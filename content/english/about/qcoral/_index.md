# More about me

### Fun facts

- **What do you do for fun?** \
I've been a pretty big fan of journaling lately, I think it really helps me gather my thoughts. I also play Overwatch occasionally.

Definitely Paramore

### Personal Projects & Interests

#### Origami

{{< gallery dir="images/qcoral/origami" class="" height="400" width="400" webp="true" command="Fit" option="" zoomable="true" >}}

Origami is something that I was first introduced to around the time I was in kindergarten, where I learned how to fold simple things like fortune tellers or boats. Around the time I was 7/8, I learned about more advanced models and developed an obsession from there. 

I joined the Origami Society of Toronto in 2013, and in 2014 I volunteered for their booth at the Toronto Maker Faire. Even though I was mainly there to help with teaching origami, this would be my first introduction to "Maker" culture and all the cool stuff with it: welding, web projects, battle bots, you name it.

At the start of 2016 I slowly stopped folding, instead being enthralled by other things like Arduino projects.

#### Voron Legacy

I first learned about 3D printing at the Maker Faire in 2014, but I never got to actually see one working in person until 2016. I became *obsessed,* wanting to learn pretty much everything about 3D printing. I became obsessed and spent hours looking at videos, comparing models and learning all about it. I begged them all summer for one, having watched every single review video that I could possibly find to make the best choice.

Eventually, they budged, and 11 year old me got a $400 3D printer (which by 2017 standards, was *insanely* cheap). It didn't work very well, but I didn't mind; it was just more tinkering for me to do.

Around a year later, I saw that some people were building their own using 3D printed parts and other components they bought online. Something I thought would be really cool would be to build a *super* big one, so I ordered some miscellaneous parts online for around $100 and started printing parts to fit together. Unfortunately though, my parents didn't think it was very safe; I abandoned the project, letting the parts sit in my room for years.

In 2021, with all the free time from the pandemic, I decided to pick the project back up. During this time, I learned of the [VORON Legacy](https://vorondesign.com/voron_legacy) design by the VORON Design team and realized that I could reuse most of my old parts for it. I finished most of it between the months of May and July, but it had to be abandoned yet again; I was moving in December and it wouldn't fit through the door of the room I built it in.

Funny enough, when the time actually came, I didn't even need to disassemble it. Regardless, I had stopped working on it for so long I had lost all motivation.

In December of 2022 though, I decided enough was enough and I would finish this thing once and for all; it was finished in January of 2023, right before the development of Neutrino.

!!! Edit this later, but it's good enough for now
Around this time though, I learned that other people were building 3D printers from *scratch*. This seemed like an awesome idea to me, so I ordered around $200 of parts online and decided to build my own. One of my dreams at the time was to have a *massive* 3D printer,

#### Mechanical Keyboards

Right before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I discovered the world of mechanical keyboards. I became pretty obsessed, even if I didn't know why (though in hindsight, I think it's because it was the perfect blend of art and STEM). I'm not really too big on it now, but the 2 years I had with it were invaluable to me; I did build services, programmed [custom firmware](https://github.com/qcoral/Arduino-KB-firmware-private), made digital renders, and designed custom boards as well. Pretty awesome.
