##### Ready to start your innovation journey? Great! This is the place. Here's how the site works:

Under **Projects** is a list of projects that you can make (although currently, there is only Neutrino). Heres an overview of each:

- [**Neutrino**](/projects/neutrino): A simple, portable 3D printer for under $200 USD. PET Bottle recycling capabilities soon!

- **TBD**: More projects to come! Got tons of ideas.

Under **Resources** is a list of pages that contain generally good to know information. These include

- [**Project Design**](/resources/project-design): A page explaining how *you* can get started with designing your own project! It consists of everything that we learned over the design of Neutrino, starting from brainstorming all the way to assembly. Currently WIP.
- **TBD**: More to come...

Under [**Blog**](/blog) is our personal blog. Anyone from the team can make a blog post.

Make sure to join the [Discord.](https://discord.com/invite/VZFWGp7FHZ) There you'll be able to connect with others and get help. It's totally worth it.
